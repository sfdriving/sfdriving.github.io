                        <p style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:top; width: 500px"> Khaled has been driving overseas for 10 years. Recently, he became an Australian resident and is
                            applying for an Australian licence. As an experienced driver, he believed he could pass the road
                            test himself easily. He took the test for the first time and failed. He then hired a driving
                            instructor for one lesson but he still did not pass his second test. Finally, he found Straightforward
                            Driving. I taught Khaled for three lessons and found him to be generally an experienced and proficient
                            driver. However there were a few issues as some of his driving habits did not comply with the
                            Australian requirements. Khaled is a good learner and worked hard to improve his driving habits.
                            With the help of Straightforward Driving, Khaled passed his third test with a near perfect score.
                            Congratulations Khaled!</p>
