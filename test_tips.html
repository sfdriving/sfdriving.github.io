        <p>A few things you need to know about road tests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obey all speed limits and traffic signs. If you fail one, you fail the test
            </li>
            <li>
                Scanning (particularly around blind spots) is critical.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain eco driving (accelerate smoothly, brake smoothly). Keep at least a 3 second gap from vehicles in front
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep at least 1 metre away from the side
            </li>
            <li>
                You are expected to demonstrate responses to hazards.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are always quiet streets, main roads and multi laned roads in the test.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are always roundabouts, turning with traffic lights and turning without traffic lights.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is always at least one school zone.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is always one street parking and either a three point turning OR reverse parking
            </li>
            <li>
                Being nervous is okay, but do not panic. If you are not confident, do not book the test.
            </li>
            <li>
                Testing officers are humans too. They are reasonable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be an average driver. Do not drive faster or slower than others. Be able to predict the behaviours of other drivers and be
                predictable yourself. Remember you are not racing, so BE AVERAGE.
